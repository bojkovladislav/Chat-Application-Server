[Link To The Frontend Side](https://github.com/bojkovladislav/Chat-Application)

## Overview

### Welcome to the Backend Documentation!

This documentation provides an overview of the backend architecture and functionality of the Chat Application. The backend is responsible for handling communication between clients, managing user authentication, and serving data via RESTful APIs.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Socket.io
- FireBase

## WebSocket Implementation (Socket.io)

### Introduction

WebSocket communication is facilitated using the Socket.io library, allowing real-time bidirectional communication between the server and clients.

### Features

1. **Real-time Messaging**: WebSocket enables real-time messaging capabilities, allowing instant communication between users.
2. **Event-Based Communication**: Socket.io utilizes event-based communication, where clients and servers can emit and listen for events.
3. **Room Management**: Socket.io supports room management, allowing users to join specific chat rooms for group conversations.

### Implementation Details

- **Initialization**: The WebSocket server is initialized within the Express.js application, allowing seamless integration with the REST API.
- **Event Handlers**: Event handlers are defined to handle various events such as user connections, disconnections, message sending, and room management.
- **Room Management**: Socket.io provides built-in mechanisms for creating and managing rooms, allowing users to join and leave rooms dynamically.

## REST API (Express.js)

### Introduction

The REST API serves as the primary interface for interacting with the backend server, providing endpoints for user authentication, and other functionalities.

### Features

1. **User Authentication**: The REST API provides endpoints for user registration, login, and authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
3. **User Management**: CRUD operations are supported for managing user profiles, including creating, updating, and deleting user accounts.

### Implementation Details

- **Routing**: Express.js routing is used to define API endpoints and their corresponding handlers.
- **Middleware**: Middleware functions are utilized for tasks such as request validation, authentication, and error handling.
- **Controllers**: Controller functions encapsulate the business logic for handling requests and generating responses.
- **Database Interaction**: The REST API interacts with the database FireBase to perform CRUD operations and retrieve/store data.

## Conclusion

The backend architecture of the Chat Application leverages WebSocket communication with Socket.io for real-time messaging and Express.js for implementing RESTful APIs. Together, these technologies enable seamless communication between clients and the server, providing users with a robust and interactive chat experience.
